README for Janux-0.4.02 as of 2013-06-11
==========

Thank you for your interest in Janux !

Janux is an open source integration tool implemented in java, spring, hibernate, html, css, and javascript. Currently it provides a set of web services that make it possible to create, store and search entities representing person and organizations, as well as a package that provides a flexible and extensible authorization scheme to control access to business services, or to vary a User Interface according to the Permissions held by an Authenticated user.

Janux can also be used as the starting point for building a robust and scalable Service Oriented Application, as it provides core pieces for creating user accounts and defining permission and roles for these users, as well as providing a blue print of how to build a modern web services stack using spring/java/hibernate.

Nevertheless, note that while janux implementation is java-based, it can be deployed in stand-alone
fashion and can interoperate with applications written in other languages.
