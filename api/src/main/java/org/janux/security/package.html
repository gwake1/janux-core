The <code>org.janux.security</code> package, contains interfaces that define a very flexible Permission-Based scheme for doing Authorization within an application; this scheme makes it possible to define whatever permissions suit a specific domain, and aggregate them into existing or new roles without having to make code changes; the key interfaces of this package are {@link org.janux.security.PermissionsCapable}, {@link org.janux.security.Account}, {@link org.janux.security.Role}, and {@link org.janux.security.PermissionContext}.
